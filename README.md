A few IRAS* sources

* IRAS05274+3345
* IRAS05358+3543
* IRAS18151-1208

## OBSNUM

three sources were taken. 16 obsnums. A default vlsr=0 was given for
all, which can't be right.

These are 400MHz data, the usualy birdies at 1024,2048, the latter
complicted reduction of IRAS18151-1208 at vlsr ~ -10

Seen in broad band, baselines are wavy. Perhaps dv=50,dw=100 is better?
